### 👋 Hi, I'm Tianyang Dou (窦天阳)

I'm an undergraduate student at **Wuhan University**, majoring in *Spatial Information and Digital Technology*（expected to graduate in June,2026）. 

I work on remote sensing image analysis for marine environments, with a focus on coral reef mapping and ocean front detection. My research explores deep learning and self-supervised methods for robust semantic understanding under noisy labels. I'm really passionate about using remote sensing to better understand our changing planet!
